    <h2>About the event</h2>

    <p>The idea for BrazilJS emerged circa 2008. A lot of tech and programming languages events were happening at the time. Jaydson and Felipe had always been Javascript enthusiasts, and they missed a conference focused on the language that they thought had the most promising future.</p>

    <p>A little while later, in 2009, the first Javascript conference appeared: JSConf. During 2010 the idead evolved. Christiano Milfont had the same idea of doing a national Javascript conference. They joined forces and in 2011 made the first Javascript conference in Brazil.</p>

    <p>In it's May 2011 announcement, BrazilJS became one of the largest Javascript events in the world, with over 600 attending and 20 speakers. In 2012 the event will have it's second edition, and we have set the goal of becoming the greatest Javascript conference in the world.</p>
