                        <p>This session will show you how you can develop a Chrome Packaged app to deliver an experience as capable as native apps, but as safe as web pages. Just like web apps, packaged apps are written in HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS. But packaged apps look and behave like native apps, and they have native-like capabilities that are much more powerful than those available to web apps.</p>

                        <strong>An Introduction to Grunt</strong>
                        <p>During this talk, Ben Alman will show you how to more easily employ popular, best-practice approaches to JavaScript development like linting your code, writing and running unit tests, and concatenating or minifying files by using grunt, the task-based JavaScript build tool. Perhaps you want to incorporate tasks like these into your application, or perhaps you just want to write a jQuery plugin and don't want to spend a lot of time setting up project scaffolding. Either way, by the end of this talk, you'll have a much better understanding on what grunt can help you do!</p>

                        <strong>Palestra: The State of JavaScript</strong>
                        <p>JavaScript has evolved over 17 years from a rushed "scripting language" into a ubiquitous and fast dynamic programming language. With the ECMAScript 6th Edition (ES6), JS is poised to become a great language for general purpose web application and library development.</p>
                        <p>JavaScript has also become the only candidate in sight for the needed role of safe, cross-browser, low-to-mid-level object file format for the Web, with dozens of programming language compilers targeting JS and its browser runtime APIs.</p>
                        <p>I will demonstrate the latest language extensions being standardized as ES6. I will then demonstrate how surprisingly efficient a modern JavaScript virtual machine can be when running non-trivial programs written in languages such as C++ compiled to JS.</p>
